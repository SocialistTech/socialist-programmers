# SPWC FOUNDING DOCUMENT

## Mission Statement

To create and support software initiatives which aid us in our goal to create effective online platforms for progressive change.

## Objectives

The SPWC has several main objectives:

1.  Maintain and support the broader socialist programmer communities that exist on various online platforms.
    
2.  Provide services of value to support other leftist organizations and worker cooperatives.
    
3.  Create platforms/tools to support & unify a global, broad left coalition, working towards furthering common leftist goals, as well as the goals of individual organizations within the coalition.
    
4.  Use our collective skills to participate in the broader economy in order to gain funding for our other goals, as well as be able to pay our members an hourly wage. Examples of this would include launching products that can bring in revenue, providing services such as technical consultation, IT support, or completing bounties/contract work.

The cooperative will adhere to its objectives through the democratic processes laid out in this document. The objectives exist to uphold the SPWC and its members, its mission statement, as well as benefiting the organizations and communities it works with.

## Membership

In order to respect time commitments members have made, there will be several types of positions for workers of the SPWC detailed below:

Onboarding of a member to SPWC will follow the process laid out below:

1.  A team opens a position by submitting the position details to the human resources department.
2.  The human resources department will advertise the position, collect applications, and conduct screening interviews.
3.  Candidates that pass human resources screening will be set up for a technical interview by the team lead.
4.  The team lead will decide whether the candidate is qualified for a paid probationary period. 
5.  After the probationary period, a team vote is initiated to determine whether the candidate is a good fit for the team. If the candidate reaches 50% support, they are qualified for 1 extension period. If the candidate reaches 75% support of the team they acquire the position and become a member.

Termination of a SPWC member or elected official will follow the process laid out below:  

1.  An anonymous complaint detailing actions which are a cause for concern as defined by the arbitration committee is filed anonymously by an SPWC member, or by the human resources department.
2.  The arbitration committee conducts an investigation into the complaint and determines whether further action is necessary.
3.  The arbitration committee votes to determine what form of action is necessary using guidelines determined by the committee or voted in by proposal. Examples of actions include: Warnings, removal from current position (eligible to apply or run for other positions), or termination from the SPWC completely.
    
## Organizational Structure
### Committees
A committee is a group of elected officials designated to make decisions related to a topic that requires either specialized experience, or that would be inefficient to make using purely democratic means. Committees will be introduced by means of a general proposal, laying out the functions, purpose, and organization of a new committee.

### Teams
The SPWC will have teams of people whose purpose is to carry out a specific function within the organization. The SPWC recognizes that the teams themselves will be the experts in how best to perform the team’s designated duty and will leave team-specific decisions to be voted on democratically by that team. A member can be on multiple teams to fulfill membership requirements. (Ex: A person with two part time positions on two separate teams of 10 hours a week each would be considered a full time member because they reach the 20 hour per week time commitment within the organization). Team members can submit team-specific proposals which will be presented and voted on at a team meeting.

Each team will have an elected “Team Leader” which is elected quarterly by the members assigned to that team.

Team leader duties include:

-   Participating in organization and department wide meetings, and representing their team’s perspective
    
-   Organizing & moderating team meetings
    
-   Coordinating with other teams working on the same project(s), and consequently designating work that needs to be done to the appropriate team members
    

  

### Departments
Departments are a collective of teams that serve a larger role within the cooperative. These departments will be led by an official from general elections. These elected officials are responsible to transparently manage the departments.

Department official duties include:
-   Participating in organization wide meetings as representatives of their department
-   Organizing and moderating department wide meetings with team leaders and other officials
-   Managing department conduct and ensuring department roles are being fulfilled
-   Handling communication between departments on issues pertaining to projects or other functions

Departments will be defined by means of general proposal, or through this document.

**Human Resources Department**
The human resources department will serve these main functions.
1.  Conflict mediation between members.
2.  Talent acquisition.
3.  Setting a standard and fair wage for positions throughout the SPWC

## Voting
All votes made by members will be anonymous by default to eliminate social pressure within the process. The voting counts will be presented to everyone to ensure transparency and discourage voting fraud. Full-time members will get two votes, part-time members will get one vote, and volunteers/apprentices are unable to vote. This applies only to amendments and general proposals. In general elections part time members and full time members each get 1 vote, while consultants and volunteers are unable to vote.

Voting will play an integral part to the operations of SPWC. There will be several types of voting procedures outlined below: 

**Amendment:** Any amendment to the founding document. The voting process for this follows the general proposal process, however it requires a super majority of 75% to be approved.

**General Proposal:** A proposal affecting resource allocation or the cooperative in general. Proposals will be submitted, presented, and discussed. A voting period of 1 week will be initiated. For the general proposal to pass, it must receive a two thirds majority of votes with at least two thirds of possible votes having been cast.

**General Election:** All elections for positions requiring a general election will occur on the designated election days listed below. General elections will follow a ranked choice voting format where every part time member and full time member gets a single vote. General elections will accept votes for one week at which point votes will be counted and winners will be determined. A specific majority is not required, only a plurality of all votes.

**Team Elections:** All team leader elections will also occur on the designated election days below. They will follow a ranked choice format where each team member gets a single vote. Team elections will accept votes for a week at which point votes will be counted and winners will be determined.

**Team Votes:** Votes that are related to individual teams (ex. Team leaders). These votes will follow the general proposal process, but can be adapted to an individual team’s needs. The majority required also will be defined by members of the team, and cannot require resources to be allocated to said team.

Both general elections & team elections will take place quarterly lasting one week in order for everyone to get a chance to vote. Election days will happen quarterly on: January 1st, April 1st, July 1st, and October 1st.

## Worker’s Compensation

When the SPWC cannot compensate its workers, debts will be allocated to them instead. Once funding is available, the members can vote to allocate funds to paying off debts. The funds allocated to paying off debts must be divided and paid in proportion to the total of SPWC’s debts. Ex. The SPWC has $1000 in debts; worker #1 being owed $300, worker #2 being owed $300 and worker #3 being owed $400. If the SPWC votes to allocate $100 to paying off debts, then workers 1 and 2 would be paid $30 and worker 3 would be paid $40.
  
Each different position that exists within the SPWC will have a strict baseline defining fair wages for that position determined by research from the human resources department. If the wage for a position needs to be increased in order to hire more workers for that position, then the wage of all existing members with that position must also be increased to match the new hires. Negotiations for a wage to be increased beyond the baseline to take in account experience and education will occur with the human resources department at the time of hire. There will also be a process for existing members to renegotiate.
